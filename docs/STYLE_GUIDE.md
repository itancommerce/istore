# Style Guide
This means choosing the standards and grammatical rules that all documents in the manual should follow. We want to pick clear, simple rules that don't distract from the main message. Having the same style will make it easier for users and keep the documents consistent, even if many people worked on them.


## Spelling
Use American spelling.

## Headings
When you're writing headings or titles for your documents, use "title case." This means you capitalize the first letter of the first word, the first letter of the last word, and all the important words in between. So, for example, instead of writing "How to install the software," you'd write "How to Install the Software." This makes your headings clear and easy to read.
